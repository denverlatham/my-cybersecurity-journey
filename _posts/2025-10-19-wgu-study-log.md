## Technical Project Logs

1. Ethics in Technology Course (October 2025):
  a. Reviewed a hypothetical scenario with an ethical issue involving a data breach for a healthcare provider. The provider failed to encrypt the PHI and did not sustain its ethical and professional duty to protect patient data. I cited HIPAA regulations and noted the potential harm to patients, public trust, and organizational image. I highlighted the broad impact on all stakeholders, referenced the Association for Computing Machinery's (ACM) Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct, and applied a deontological framework to address the issue. I also compared the deontological framework against a utilitarian framework. 
  b. Reviewed the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct and described how professional codes of conduct benefit professions. According to the ACM, codes of ethics guide behavior because they 'inspire and guide the ethical conduct', such as when doctors take the Hippocratic oath to do no harm. I also noted that codes of conduct often include procedures for addressing instances where a professional violates the code, which deters individuals from acting unethically. Lastly, I applied ACM code 1.4 to my current role, emphasizing acting without discrimination and acting with fairness, and code 1.6 for respecting privacy by securing data and obtaining consent before sharing information with other agencies.
2. Completed hands-on practice for hardware troubleshooting with CertMaster for CompTIA A+, including system assembly, network configurations, identifying components, network and PC architecture, connectivity standards, etc. Passed the Core 1 (220-1201) exam the first attempt on 11/29/2025. I studied for it for six weeks. Now, I am working on the study materials for core 2 (220-1202).
3. Completed coursework on prompt engineering principles (D685), focusing on designing effective prompts for various AI use cases. Key concepts: specificity, context-setting, role assignment, iteration, and understanding how different models respond to prompt structure. In practice, I regularly use multiple AI platforms (ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Claude, DeepSeek, Grok, etc.) and strategically switch between them depending on task requirements and model strengths, applying prompt optimization techniques to improve response quality and accuracy.
