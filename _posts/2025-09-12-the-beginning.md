# Boot Sequence: The Beginning

This page is the story of how a kid with an Apple IIe grew into a mid-career professional pivoting into Information Technology. It is about where I started, what shaped me, and why I am committed to protecting systems and the people behind them. The rest of this page traces that journey - from those first POST beeps and crashes to the choices I am making now to build a career in IT. 

## Initial Login: Early Curiosity

I started this journey a long time ago, with an Apple IIe and a couple of floppy disks at 12 years old. As I grew, and I became exposed to IBM and Windows 3.11, I wanted to learn more. My parents never really had the money for the latest and greatest of technology, so it was not until I moved out, got married and was 21 before I was REALLY exposed to the inner workings of technology. 

My initial 'login' began with a Sony VAIO desktop with Windows 95, and staying up at all hours on the phone with tech support (repeatedly) after accidentally crashing my system. With every crash, I would repeat the steps from the previous call, then, when I was stuck and could not move forward, I would call back. I learned a lot just from those interactions.

## Traceroute Through Other Careers: The Long Detour

For the next 17 years, technology remained a constant companion—but not as a career. From 2001 to 2017, I worked in education with students who were Deaf, eventually becoming a certified educational ASL interpreter. During that time, I became the unofficial IT person. Colleagues would come to me when their computers froze, applications weren't saving correctly, or they just needed someone who wouldn't make them wait for the official help desk. 

While I didn't have formal training, I had an analytical mind and a stubborn refusal to give up on problems. People joked that I had the "magic touch" because I'd walk over, start troubleshooting, and things would just work. The truth was simpler: I was willing to try many different approaches until something clicked.

## Routing Experience Packets: Skills I Brought With Me

Throughout my career—whether interpreting for large groups, teaching, presenting at community events, or coordinating programs at the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation—I developed strong communication and problem-solving skills. I learned to explain complex concepts to diverse audiences, document processes clearly, and step in wherever I was needed. 

Currently, as a Service Coordinator at the California Department of Rehabilitation, I work with youth with disabilities, handling sensitive client information, performing data analysis, and regularly presenting to school administrators, families, and community partners. Technology has always been part of how I serve others, but it was never the focus—until now.

## Logging Into Cybersecurity: How/Why I Chose This Degree

The decision to formally pursue IT and cybersecurity came down to aligning my strengths with my family's needs. I've always had a natural interest in technology and an analytical approach to problem-solving. I don't like seeing people taken advantage of, and I want to build a career where I can help protect systems and the people who rely on them. 

I chose Western Governors University's BS in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance because their competency-based model works well for how I learn—I can focus on one course at a time and move at my own pace. I'm also an active member of the ISC² Los Angeles Chapter, attending regular meetings with guest speakers to build my knowledge and professional network. This degree is my tool to get in the door. From there, I'll figure out where I want to go—but I know I'm committed to doing this right.
