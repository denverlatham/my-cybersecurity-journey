# The Beginning

I started this journey a long time ago,with an Apple IIe and a couple of floppy disks at 12 years old. As I grew, and I became exposed to IBM and Windows 3.11, I wanted to learn more. My parents never really had the money for the latest and greatest of technology, so it was not until I moved out, got married and was 21 before I was REALLY exposed to the inner workings of technology. It began with a Sony VAIO desktop with Windows 95, and staying up at all hours on the phone with tech support (repeatedly) after accidentally crashing my system. With every crash, I would repeat the steps from the previous call, then, when I was stuck and could not move forward, I would call back. I learned a lot just from those interactions.
